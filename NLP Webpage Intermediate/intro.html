            Basically I applied to this research project that may involve developing a mobile version of a Snellen chart and Python isn't great to make mobile apps. JavaScript is a much better option for Android development and so I started learning how to use JS through web development. But since I have great disdain for HTML, CSS, and web development in general, I tied it into a ML project that I can manage in Python. So this set of webpages and files are designed to illustrate some of the insights I was able to uncover with basic applied Machine Learning in Python's SKLearn and XGBoost libraries.

            Am I jeopardizing my medical education? Most likely not; there's enough time to study everything because I barely went out in Toronto and now I have even less reason.

            Also if you're wondering, I didn't use TensorFlow for this project. I'm trying to learn ML from the ground up so I wouldn't start there. I used SKLearn and XGBoost but their logos suck so I used TF's logo.
