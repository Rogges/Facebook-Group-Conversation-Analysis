            Vocabulary Size is estimated by counting up the unique words used by a member across all of their messages. So if you used "yo" 1000 times across the past two years, it would only count as 1 word in your vocabulary. The vocabulary size:message count ratio is a metric I came up with to see how many unique words a person will use in any given message. Thannoj leads the pack with 1.16 unique words per message but I suppose that's to be expected given how little he messages anyways.

            Aushvin's numbers are however interesting. Despite having 2-4x the messages as Harris or Ali Nawed, his vocabulary is still smaller than theirs. This is quite unexpected as people with more messages typically have a larger absolute vocabulary size. His vocab to message ratio is closer to people that have far more messages than he does which suggests a greater deal of repetitive word use in messages than other members. A conservative conclusion on this note might be that Aushvin's messages have been disproprtionately affected by pre-processing. A more liberal and, in my opinion, superior conclusion is that Aushvin should spend less time watching the NBA and more time reading.
