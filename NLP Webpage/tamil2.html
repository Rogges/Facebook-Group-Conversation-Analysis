            Classifying the Tamils (except Thannoj (not enough messages))
        </div>
        <div class="text1">
            Okay so this is mostly just taking the piss. Classifying 5 people with moderate text processing on a regular classification model is extremely hectic and unlikely to yield really good results but I figured what the heck. It's going to be about a year or two before I'm working on neural networks so I might as well just mess around now. Again XGBoost did much better than I expected here with a strong 50% which is 30% better than chance. I also used a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm which got a strong 53% accuracy rate on the test set but neither model was very good and I'll explain that shortly.

            These models only performed slightly worse than the model classifying myself, Saad, and Javed yet I'm saying these ones are bad despite having the additional load of 2 more people to classify. They suck because they fail the eye test miserably.

            Markov Chains
        </div>
        <div class="text1">
            So instead of subjecting you to nonsense predictions and classifications from the trained models, enjoy sentences generated by Markov Chains. Most of the ones I've selected to display are sentences that I think each person may have a reasonable probability of saying. I did however leave some really random nonsensical sentences in too because they were funny to me at 12AM after my anatomy exam.

            If you're wondering if I could've done this Markov chain stuff with everyone's data, then you're right, it would've been a simple extension of the work I've already done but I'm not going to do that because I don't feel like it.
