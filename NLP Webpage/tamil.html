            Classifying the Tamils (except Thannoj (not enough messages))

            Okay so this is mostly just taking the piss. Classifying 5 people with moderate text processing on a regular classification model is extremely hectic and unlikely to yield really good results but I figured what the heck. It's going to be about a year or two before I'm working on neural networks so I might as well just mess around now. Again XGBoost did much better than I expected here with a strong 50% which is 30% better than chance. I also used a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm which got a strong 53% accuracy rate on the test set but neither model was very good and I'll explain that shortly.

            These models only performed slightly worse than the model classifying myself, Saad, and Javed yet I'm saying these ones are bad despite having the additional load of 2 more people to classify. They suck because they fail the eye test miserably.
