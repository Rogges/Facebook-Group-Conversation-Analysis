            The next step for me to take with the group conversations are building chat bots to emulate each member and using something like the Gensim library to do topic extraction. Topic extraction is a type of unsupervised machine learning (can be supervised too) that groups conversations by similarities in words used. In other words, the ML algorithm tries to create categories or topics of conversation. Topic extraction requires quite a bit of text processing to be maximally effective unless everyone in the group uses perfect grammar and spelling which is 99.9% unlikely. Chat bots actually don't need that much text processing because you'd want the bot to capture spelling mistakes and other stuff to accurately emulate people. Still, it's a little more complicated so I'd rather not focus on learning the details of that while working on learning HTML/CSS/JS.

            I'm also planning on learning to use Regular Expression (regex) to help filter out nonsense words but retain slang and idiosyncratic spellings/terms and see if that changes model accuracy at all.

            The next stage of development doesn't have a production schedule yet so I can't say when it'll be done with any precision. Obviously, I'm juggling med school but I'm also looking at getting involved in a Neurology/Opthalmology research project on top of learning ML from the ground up and JavaScript/mobile development. I hope to be done by the time I enter 3rd year but we'll see how much progress or lack thereof I make.
